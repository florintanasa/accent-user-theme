# Accent User Theme
It is a Gnome extension that changes the user's theme based on the accent color chosen by the user in Gnome Settings, Appearance screen and by preferred color schema Light or Dark.    
The extension is a modification of the [Accent Color Icon Theme Changer For GNOME](https://github.com/taiwbi/gnome-accent-directories) extension, thank you `Mohammad Mahdi Tayebi` for your work.  
This extension is included in **BRGV-OS** Linux distribution.
